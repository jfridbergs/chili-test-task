My submission of a test task for a Junior Mobile developer position at Chili Labs.

I completed the task in Android using Jetpack Compose. For API calls I used ktor.

For result paging I used a solution I found in a youtube video "How to Implement Pagination With Jetpack Compose - Android Studio Tutorial" by Philipp Lackner (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6Eus3f6U9I)
Note: Perhaps with no previous knowledge about paging, I should've worked with Paging 3, but the solution presented in the video was very well explained and very intuitive, and I had little trouble implementing it and adjusting to my needs.

I also wrote couple tests covering live search input, fetching and displaying results and result paging
